## Introduction

This is a mini-full stack project I use to learn mongoDB. The frontend code, which can be found in fronend-deploy branch, is fairly easy. The main branch contains the APIs I created with express and mongoDB. The server is deployed to Render webservices. The backend code is organized in a way that I hope is clear. 

The user can enter any quotes that he finds to be funny/trolling/useful translation of English usages. Once the user submits, the sentence will be stored to mongoDB.
Hopefully I can expand this tiny project to a full application in the future.
